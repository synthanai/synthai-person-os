# /person , Initialize The Full OS Pipeline

> *"You are not starting a conversation. You are building a system."*

**PERSON** is the master orchestrator. It does not execute any work itself. It orients the professional, confirms which workflows to run, and launches the full 6-verb pipeline in sequence. Think of this as the onboarding verb: it establishes intent, calibrates expectations, and prevents the most common failure mode of partial initialization (running `/narrate` without first running `/profile`).

**Pipeline position**: ENTRY ORCHESTRATOR
**Reads**: Nothing (clean start)
**Writes to**: Nothing directly (delegates to child workflows)
**Launches**: `/profile` → `/experience` → `/resonate` → `/strategise` → `/operate` → `/narrate`
**Meta verbs available at any stage**: `/research`, `/debate`

## Usage

```
/person
```

Run this once at the beginning of a new Person OS initialization. If the professional has an existing `profile/CORE.md`, they can skip directly to any downstream verb.

---

## Step 1: Orient

Introduce the OS to the professional:

> "The Person OS is a 6-verb professional intelligence system. Each verb extracts a different layer of your professional architecture and persists it as a structured artifact that AI can read and use to work at your actual level of capability.
>
> The 6 verbs run in this sequence:
>
> 1. **/profile** — Who you are, fundamentally. (C.O.R.E.)
> 2. **/experience** — What you have proven, specifically. (S.T.O.R.Y.)
> 3. **/resonate** — Who scales your capability, precisely. (N.E.T.W.O.R.K.)
> 4. **/strategise** — Where you are going and what you are sacrificing. (G.R.O.W.T.H.)
> 5. **/operate** — How you show up every day, mechanically. (R.H.Y.T.H.M.)
> 6. **/narrate** — What you say externally, and how. (S.O.C.I.A.L. + H.S.P.)
>
> The meta verbs can be used at any stage:
> - **/research** "[topic]" — Filter external intelligence through your CORE profile.
> - **/debate** "[decision]" — Stress-test a critical choice before committing.
>
> Each verb produces a markdown artifact in your local directory. These artifacts are your OS state. They accumulate over time. They get richer with each iteration.
>
> Ready to start?"

---

## Step 2: Calibrate Entry Point

Ask the professional:

> "Have you run any of these verbs before? Do you have a `profile/CORE.md` in your directory?"

**If YES:** Ask which verb they want to run next. Route them directly to that workflow. Do not re-run earlier verbs unless they explicitly choose to refresh them.

**If NO:** Begin the full sequence. Start with `/profile` immediately.

---

## Step 3: Set Expectations

Before starting `/profile`, tell the professional:

> "The full sequence takes approximately 2-3 hours across multiple sessions. You do not have to do it in one sitting.
>
> The quality of every downstream output is directly constrained by the quality of what you produce in `/profile`. If you give me a shallow answer in `/profile`, I will give you a shallow strategy in `/strategise`. The system is only as honest as you are in the interrogation.
>
> I will push back on vague answers. That is not rudeness. That is the system working correctly."

---

## Step 4: Launch

Proceed directly to `/profile` without waiting for further confirmation. The professional has already approved by engaging with `/person`.
